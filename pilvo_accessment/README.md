There are couple of scripts  

 1. Registration sipp script
 2. Python script will run the call and Display the Call Summary

     For this as I was facing problem from Receving side, So I have registered the client "Micro Sip" and initiated call from SiPP script

     So while running the script we need to have one client and one SIPp client

 All the Sipp Scripts, Python Script and Flow logs are pushed to reposistory
 
 
 As I was 486 Buy and 480 Temporarily unavailable , I followed the above approach
